# PeriodicTimer
A simple mac OS app that allows Gym For All to have a periodic bell every ten minutes. Classes start at 3pm, 4pm, and 5pm and rotations are 10,15, or 20 minutes long. GfA wanted a way to know when the rotation was over for that event. 

This app helps with that and was built as a simple starter app!
